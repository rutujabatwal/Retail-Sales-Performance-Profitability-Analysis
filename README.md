# Retail Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 20,000+ retail sales transactions to evaluate revenue trends, profitability drivers, discount impact, and regional performance. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
